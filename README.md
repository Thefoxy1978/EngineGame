"Development Challenges"

The primary challenge in this project was independently designing and structuring all game levels within the AIV.Fast.2d proprietary engine. Building the entire game structure from scratch required a strong command of the engineâ€™s capabilities and extensive planning to ensure cohesive gameplay flow across levels.
